# ‚¨áÔ∏è Install
`npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-capsolver`

# ‚úã Usage
‚ùó This plugin only helps retrieving solving tasks from api.capsolver.com based on [capsolver-npm](https://github.com/0qwertyy/capsolver-npm)

- Initialize `SolverPlugin` and use it within `puppeteer-extra`.
- Then call `await page.solver()` to retrieve and use the solver at any moment.
```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-extra");
const SolverPlugin = require("puppeteer-extra-plugin-capsolver")("CAP-XXXXXX ...");
puppeteer.use(SolverPlugin);

puppeteer.launch().then(async (browser) => {
    try {
        let page = await browser.newPage();

        await page.goto("https://example.com/");

        let solution = await page.solver().hcaptchaproxyless({
            websiteURL: "https://example.com/",
            websiteKey: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        });

        // use your solution (solution.gRecaptchaResponse in this case)
        // ...
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
    } finally {
        await browser.close();
    }
